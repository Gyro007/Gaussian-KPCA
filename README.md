# Gaussian-kpca

## Description
This is a machine learning project under the University of Warwick for the course CS342 Machine Learning. In this project, I attempt to make a 2d dataset linearly separable by using the kernel-trick with the Gaussian RBF Kernel. The purpose of this project is to code Kernel PCA from scratch without using the kpca library from SciPy and determine the minimum number of principal components that are required to separate the data linearly via a single decision stump. The transformed data was plotted in 3D to illustrate the decision boundary along the z-axis.
